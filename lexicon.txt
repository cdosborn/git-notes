Vocab
^^^^^
Repository
    A project (folder) tracked by git

Remote
    A repository that isn't on your local machine (ex. on github)

Commit
    A documented set of changes

Hash
    Part of a commit, which uniquely identifies the commit
    in the repository (ex. f3410e...)

Index/Stage
    An area for preparing/building a commit, see git add
    
Working tree
    A name for the files in your current directory

HEAD
    A name for your last commit, much easier than entering the long
    hash...

Untracked files
    files that have never been added in git. Git only watches files that have
    ever been staged/committed. 

Branch
    A string of commits.
    Like the name suggests, a branch is where the history takes a new
    direction. Two branches may represent two different approaches to a
    problem. Branches can be merged, or even further branched.

Master
    The default branch for a new repository



Commands
^^^^^^^^
git status
    Get a status of the working tree and the index.

git branch 
    List all branches

git diff
   Display the differences between your directory and your index. Answers the
   question, "What else could I add to the index in preparation for the next commit?" 
    
git log 
    Lookup history (traverse the latest commits)

git show <commit hash>
    Lookup up a single commit

git init 
    Create a new git repository

git add <file>
    Stage the changes in this file (from the working tree) for the next commit

git commit -m "Renamed some important files"
    Take all the changes in the index and create a commit. 
    Here the message (-m) is a summary associated with set of changes prepared
    in the index.  The index is now reset to prepare for the next commit.

git push origin master
    Take my latest commits and add them to the master branch on the origin
    repository

git clone <url/path>
    Copy the repository at that url or path into the current directory

git fetch <remote>
    Update our local copy of the remote repository (this has no effect on our
    history)

git merge <branch>
    Merge branch into the current branch. 

More commands:
git diff --staged
    List changes on the stage

git diff <commit> <commit>
    Compare the differences between two snapshots of the project 

git merge-base <commit> <commit> 
    Print the common ancestor of two commits

git fsck
    Print objects that no longer possess a reference

git ls-tree <tree>
    Print the objects which exist in the tree object

git reflog
    Print the log of changes to refs like HEAD, master, etc.

git cat-file -t <object>
