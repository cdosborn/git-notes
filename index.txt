A lesson on git

./motivate.txt * Explain why even to use git

The purpose of this lesson is to teach git. At each step of the lesson our
model of git will evolve. When our use of git becomes more demanding, we'll
extend our model. 

Understanding this model will be critical. It'll allow us to ask the right
questions. By knowing the fundamentals of git, you'll be able to say, "Hrm it
seems like git should be able to do x, let me google that." You'll be able to
look stuff up on your own.

The other approach is to just memorize a bunch of commands without context,
which can be overwhelming and not fun! Many people do this :@

./commit-model.txt * The first layer of the git data model
./commit-impl.txt  * Create/view/compare a few commits
ref-model          * The second layer of the git data model (branches/refs)
ref-impl           * Jump around commit graph / create divergent histories
remote-model       * The second layer of the git data model (remotes)
remote-impl        * Jump around commit graph / create divergent histories

The core data: commits/refs/repos
The secondary data: branches(refs to commits)/remotes(refs to repos)

Vocabulary (git jargon):

SHA/Hash
Commit 
Repo/Repository 
Clone
