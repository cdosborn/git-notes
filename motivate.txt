| Motivate - Explain why even to use git

Who uses undo when they work?  What are some pros/cons of simple undo?

    pros: 
        - great for small changes
    cons: 
        - cannot support multiple histories (usually)
        - easy to lose something

How do you share work? (Email/Dropbox/GoogleDrive)?

    Git reduces the friction here significantly. Typically there is a central
    server that hosts the project. Everyone has a local copy of the project, it's
    convenient to get the latest project, and it's convenient to contribute back. 

    How does an international team of collaborators work on a project, how do
    they coordinate?   

    *Some evidence*: Git was created for developing the linux kernel.
    Nearly 12,000 developers have contributed to the Linux kernel since tracking
    began 10 years ago. On average there are eight changes an hour, or two every
    15 minutes.
