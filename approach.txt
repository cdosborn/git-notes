| Approach - Lexicon, keeping the world small

Git is a power tool
    It's not the most friendly. The hammer doesn't ask you if you intend to
    smash your thumb, it just let's it happen. Fortunately git makes it very
    hard to lose your work, once is committed, it can be retrieved!

Git is a black box.
    Many of the git commands are just about interrogating git, and seeing
    what's going on. We're going to learn how to ask these questions.

Git has its own lexicon.
    The first time you run a command you get bombarded by jaron, and we're
    going to be intentional about exposing the jargon early. 

Summary:
    We're going to tread carefully.

    This workshop has a unique approach in that we're not going to stress
    workflows as much as concepts! Missing this is the biggest mistake when
    introducing git.
